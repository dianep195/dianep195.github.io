			 <h2>Projects:</h2>
			 <h3>Summer 2023</h3>
			<a>In Summer 2023, I completed several small personal projects in my free time to broaden and practice my
				skills while having fun! </a>
			 <ol>
				 <li>Portfolio Website
					 <p>Created this site: a Github pages site using basic HTML and CSS.</p></p>
				 </li>
				 <br>
				 <li>Hardware
					 <p>Worked through basic Arduino and electronic component projects, 
						 to increase familiarity with a range of electronic hardware. Here are a few
						 select examples. </p>
					 <p>Metronome: 555 timer in astable configuration which blinks an LED about once a second. 
					 	Precision was limited by capacitor and resistor values on hand.</p>
					<video controls src="metronome.mp4" width=250>--></video>
					<p>"Arduino Projects Book" Light Theremerin: My local library had an Arduino available to check out, 
						so I was able to complete several sample projects contained in the Arduino Projects Book. 
						This was one of my favorites, a device which plays a tone based on the value of a photoresistor. </p>

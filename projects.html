			 <h3>Summer 2023</h3>
			<a>In Summer 2023, I completed several small personal projects in my free time to broaden and practice my
				skills while having fun! </a>
			 <ol>
				 <li>Portfolio Website
					 <p>Created this site: a Github pages site using basic HTML and CSS.</p></p>
				 </li>
				 <br>
				 <li>Hardware
					 <p>Worked through basic Arduino and electronic component projects, 
						 to increase familiarity with a range of electronic hardware. Here are a few
						 select examples. </p>
					 <p>Rules-Based NLP: Very simple rules-based NLP Python script which sends the classification result to an Arduino LCD display over serial. 
					 	Classifies strings as belonging to recipes('r'), directions('d'), or inconclusive('i') based on occurances of sample words associated
					 	with directions or recipes.</p>

					 	<img src="arduinocode.png"alt="logo" width="500";>
					 <p>Metronome: 555 timer in astable configuration which blinks an LED about once a second. 
					 	Precision was limited by capacitor and resistor values on hand.</p>
						<video controls src="metronome.mp4" width=250;></video>
					<p>"Arduino Projects Book" Light Theremerin: My local library had an Arduino available to check out, 
						so I was able to complete several sample projects contained in the Arduino Projects Book. 
						This was one of my favorites, a device which plays a tone based on the value of a photoresistor. </p>
